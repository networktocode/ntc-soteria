# Batfish ACL Auditor
This repo contains an ACL auditing tool based on Batfish. The goal of this tool is to help you automate the process of validating your firewall ACLs, and access. Along with providing a foundation from which you can learn more about performing network automation with Batfish.

## Audits
This tool provides the ability to perform 2 types of audits against an ACL rule base.

* **ACL Reference Comparision** - This audit takes 3 pieces of information, a single YAML file containing a set of reference flows, the configuration of your firewall, and also the ACL name in question. It then calculates the difference between your reference flows and implemented flows, to provide you with the differences. Some use cases for this include:
  * Prevent human error, during firewall changes. For example incorrect addition of ip any any.
  * Allows you to run routine scripted checks against your ACL base to ensure no ACLs are opened by bad actors.
  * As this can function as a CLI script you can add this to part of your ACL CI pipelines.
* **Unreachable ACL Entries** - This check takes a firewall configuration containing your ACL rule sets. It then reports on any lines in the specified filters that will not match any packet, either because of being shadowed by prior lines or because of its match condition being empty. The key use cases for this are:
  * Prevent human error, during firewall changes. For example, incorrect placement of an encompassing deny rule.
  * Assist in keeping your ACL rule sets minimal and free of unnecessary lines.
  * As this can function as a CLI script you can add this to part of your ACL CI pipelines.

## Prerequisites
This tool requires that you have a Batfish service running. This is installed on a Docker like so:
```
docker pull batfish/allinone
docker run --name batfish -d -v batfish-data:/data -p 8888:8888 -p 9997:9997 -p 9996:9996 batfish/allinone
```

You must also have `poetry` installed.  This can be installed like so:

```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdispater/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python3
source $HOME/.poetry/env
```
You also need Python 3.

## Installation
To install this tool run the following commands:
```
git clone git@github.com:networktocode/batfish-acl-auditor.git
cd batfish-acl-auditor
poetry install
poetry shell
```

## Usage
Below shows the various options for this tool. Note: Sample files are provided within the `./data` directory for initial testing.
Before running any of the commands you will need to set an environment variable for your Batfish host, like so: `export BATFISH_SERVICE_HOST=localhost`.

### ACL Reference Comparision
```
./acl_auditor/auditor.py -c compare -d data/asa.cfg -r data/flows.yml -a acl-inside 
```
### Unreachable ACL Entries
```
./acl_auditor/auditor.py -c unreachable -d data/asa.cfg
```
### HTML Report
An HTML report can be generated with the results. However, this option can only be run when running the `-c all` (check all) option.
```
./acl_auditor/auditor.py -c all -d data/asa.cfg -r data/flows.yml -a acl-inside -o html
```
Once complete a HTML report will be saved within `./data`. Below shows an example:

**Note:** The HTML report generated uses the following Material/Bootstrap framework: https://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/.
